In many cities, access to clean potable water is limited. People up buying plastic bottles, creating waste and spending unnecessarily.

**BE Water Stand changes that.** We:
- Help people stay hydrated for free 
- Reduce single-use plastic bottles
- Offer companies and NGOs a space to promote eco and social messages

All while improving public access to clean drinking water.
